Welcome to 09Slackware07 version 13.0 (Linux kernel 2.6.29.6)!

If you need to pass extra parameters to the kernel, enter them at the prompt
below after the name of the kernel to boot (huge.s etc).  NOTE: If your machine
is not at least a Pentium-Pro, you *must* boot and install with the huge.s
kernel, not the hugesmp.s kernel!  For older machines, use "huge.s" at the
boot prompt.

In a pinch, you can boot your system from here with a command like:

boot: hugesmp.s root=/dev/hda1 rdinit= ro 

In the example above, /dev/hda1 is the / Linux partition.

This prompt is just for entering extra parameters.  If you don't need to enter
any parameters, hit ENTER to boot the default kernel "hugesmp.s" or press [F2] 
for a listing of more kernel choices.
